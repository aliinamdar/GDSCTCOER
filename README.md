## **Android Study Jams**

### **GDSCTCOER**

An application that helps the members of our GDSC to keep a track on all the Upcoming Events and Register on time.

## **Problem Statement** 
During pandemic, everything is virtual so members are unaware of the on-going activities in the club. Through this app all the club members can easily keep track on the upcoming events, club activities, receive notification when the event is added and receive reminder notification before the schedule time of the event.

## **Proposed Solution**

We have designed an app "GDSCTCOER" that helps the members of our club to track all the upcoming events. We have used a Firebase firestore to store the data in the database and firebase storage for storing the image. We have also included some features like members can easily navigate to RSVP link of the Upcoming events by clicking on the RSVP button, after the event is completed the watch button will appear which contains the recording of the event, members will receive notification whenever a new event will be added from the back-end and before the time of scheduled event student will receive a reminder notification. This contains all the information related to our club with all our social media handles linked and the information of the entire core Team with their social media handles so that club members can easily connect with them.

## **Functionality & Concepts used**

This application has a simple yet interactive interface so that the members could easily interact with this application without any problems. Following are the concepts used in application to provide various functionalities.

- `Linear Layout`: Aligns the elements in a single direction i.e. vertically or horizontally.
- `Relative Layout`: Which is specified as relative to sibling elements (such as to the left-of or below another view) .
- `Recycler View` : For displaying all the events and the information of the club.
- `fragments` : Fragment to improve app response time.
- `Bottom Navigation Bar` : To switch to different fragments easily.
- `Firebase` : For Back-end.
- `Firebase Cloud Messaging` : Providing notification when the event is added and reminding before the schedule time.

## Future Scope 
This app is used by the Core Team members of GDSC TCOER right now. After proper testing is performed this application will be deployed on Google Play Store. We are planning to integrate chat sessions where the members of the club can interact with the core team members.
