## **Android Study Jams**

### **GDSCTCOER**
<p><p> A app that help the memeber's to keep a track on the Upcoming Events in the GDSCTCOER Club.<br></p>

## **Problem Statements** 

During pandemic, Everything is virtual so member's are  unaware of the  ongoing activities in the club. Through this app the  member's can easy track on the upcoming events, club activities, recieve notification  when the event is added and receive reminder notification before the schedule time of the event.

## **Proposed Solution**

We have designed a app "GDSCTCOER" that helps the member's of the club to track the upcoming events. This application was build by keep in mind that the member's should aware of the upcomming events. We have use a Firebase firestore to store the data in the database and firebase storage from storing the image. We have also included some feature's like member's can easy navigate to RSVP link of the Upcoming events by click on the RSVP button,  after the events is completed the watch button will appear it will contain the recording of the event, member's will receive notification whenever the event will added from the back-end and before the time of sechduled event student will recieve a reminder notification . This contains the all information of the club with the social media handle and the information of all the core Team Member's with there social media handle where they can easy connect to the club.  

## **Functionality & Concepts used**

This application has a simple yet interactive interface so that the member's could easily interact with this application without any problems. Following are the concepts used in application to provide functionalities.

- `Linear Layout`: Which align the element in the single direction vertically or horizontally.
- `Relative Layout`: Which  specified as relative to sibling elements (such as to the left-of or below another view) .
- `Recycler View` : For displaying all the events and the information of the club.
- `fragments` : Fragment to improve app respone time.
- `Bottom Navigation Bar` : To switch to different fragments easily.
- `Firebase` : For Back-end.
- `Firebase Cloud Messaging` : Providing notification when the event is added and reminding before the sechedule time.
